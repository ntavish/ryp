Router youtube player
=====================

Uses unofficial google speech recognition API for playing youtube songs/whatever using just voice. It is written for an embedded device running OpenWrt, should work at other places also.

Seeedstudio's respeaker, which uses Bing's (official) speech recognition API reminded me that I had written this a long time ago.
